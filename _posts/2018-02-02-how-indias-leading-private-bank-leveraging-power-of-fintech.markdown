Innovation in financial services is critical to meet the growing demands of new-age customers. The new generation of customers are well aware of their needs and prefer a solution that is not only user-friendly and intuitive, but efficient.

The focus on banking innovation with an emphasis on digitization has been at the forefront ever since the advent of smartphones and Internet. According to McKinsey, banks who adopt a strong digitization strategy are able to increase their sales and revenues by 4% to 16% through enhanced customer relationship management and increased product cross-selling. Changing consumer behavior and preferences forced financial institutions to adjust the delivery of services across channels to ensure seamless experiences.

HDFC Bank,[ India’s largest private bank](https://qz.com/1120610/hdfc-bank-replaces-a-bruised-icici-bank-to-become-indias-largest-private-bank/), has embraced all of these trends and has emerged as a customer-centric organization with personalized offers and innovative products and services to the market. HDFC Bank’s Digital Innovation Summit (DIS) offers an opportunity for FinTech startups to engage with banks and integrate their solutions with the bank’s product offering.

The[ 3rd Digital Innovation Summit](https://www.hdfcbank.com/htdocs/common/Digital_Innovation_Summit/index.html) is currently underway and interested startups are invited to present their solutions to the leadership team and for exploring potential partnerships. The winners of the summit will get the opportunity to integrate their solutions within the bank’s system and reach their extensive customer base.

## Digital Innovation Summit

With its annual Digital Innovation Summit, HDFC Bank aims to create a platform to encourage innovation in the FinTech space. This initiative is a part of the bank’s strategic focus on leveraging technology to simplify the lives of customers, and its vision to embrace the wave of disruptive innovation in the FinTech space in the country and create a platform to nurture the spirit of innovation and enterprise. The main objective of the event is to engage with FinTech startups in the BFSI domain, whilst exploring new and disruptive ideas that fit into the overall objective of simplifying their customer's lives.

The first two editions of the summit were a huge success and saw a total of 72 startups present their solutions to a jury comprising of the bank’s and its Group companies’ senior management team from across businesses. Companies were shortlisted based on uniqueness and innovation, business potential, usability & scalability, and compatibility with the bank’s business & technology platforms. HDFC Bank collaborated with these startups to deploy their products within its infrastructure.

Feedback from some of the startup founders who have benefited from the association with HDFC speaks for itself:

> “HDFC Bank Innovation Summit has been a great opportunity for us to work on real-world problems and deploy our products at (the) massive scale of the bank. The bank has been extremely supportive and encouraging at every step, making it a pleasure to innovate and grow along with the bank” – Ritesh Radhakrishnan, Co-founder & CTO of Senseforth AI Research Private Limited.

> “We gained some really valuable press exposure as a result of winning HDFC's Digital Innovation Summit. Additionally, our participation was great for networking and developing a lasting and fruitful relationship with HDFC, and a strategic entrance to the Indian market” – Daniel Peled & Offer Markovich, Co-founders PayKey.
