<p>Interbank Mobile Payment Service (IMPS) is gaining popularity in India. Most of the major banks are extending this service to account holders to access accounts and transfer funds using mobile phones.</p>
<p>National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has also announced extension of IMPS service to merchant payments as a form of support to IMPS. Banks such as State Bank of India, ICICI, Kotak Mahindra, Axis Bank, etc. have enabled IMPS based merchant payment system and the rest of the banks are either in the testing or developmental phase.</p>
