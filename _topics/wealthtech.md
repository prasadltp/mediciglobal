In recent years, new companies have arrived on the scene offering advice based on artificial intelligence and big data, micro-investment platforms, or trading solutions based on social networks. WealthTech includes topics like robo-retirement, digital brokers, personal finance management (PFM). micro-investing, and other portfolio management tools. 

This broader category is known as WealthTech and can be further broken down into several sub-categories, that largest of which is Robo-advisors.  Robo-advisors are automated services that use machine-learning algorithms to offer users advice based on the most profitable investment options in the market, yield targets, the userâ€™s risk aversion profile and other variables such as age and income.
