We respect your privacy. Period. We live in your world too and we will never do anything with your information that we would not want to be done with ours. It's that simple! Of course, there's a longer version for you to review:

After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be kept on file for more than 60 days.

Yes.

We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
