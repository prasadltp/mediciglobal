**The Quest For #Cashless Society
By Mehul Desai
Published by MEDICI Studio**


August of Money examines the ongoing evolution of cash towards a true Cashless transaction environment. Based on the premise that while cash has always been a state-driven public utility whereas cash-replacement is a private endeavor, August of Money presents a different approach towards building a true Cashless Society, connecting the dots between eCommerce, Big Data and IoT, proposing the building blocks for Utility and Usability, and speculating on how the ePlumbing for Cashless will impact everything from socioeconomic growth to national security.
