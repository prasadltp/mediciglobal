## Featured Global Partnerships

We can’t drive FinTech-at-SCALE alone — and we don’t want to! We’re grateful for *all* of our partners who are instrumental in strengthening the FinTech ecosystem.

> *"MEDICI is a great success story! I admire the founders' contributions to helping the financial services industry appreciate FinTech as the rails for the new economy. As a strategic ally of our Technology for Integrity initiative, the company was instrumental in raising global awareness of the power of FinTech in fighting corruption."*
>
> **-Jay Collins, Vice Chairman, Citi**

At any given time, MEDICI is working with more than a dozen global, FinTech-focused, open innovation programs. We’re retained by banks, insurance companies, and tech enterprises to design and manage their engagement with startups.
