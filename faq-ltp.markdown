**Why are you consolidating your Let’s Talk Payments and MEDICI brands?**

Some of you know us as Let’s Talk Payments and some of you know us as MEDICI. But regardless of the brand under which you’ve consumed our offerings, we’ve always been a single company with a single mission: to bring clarity and collaboration to the complex ecosystem of FinTech in order to enable FinTech-at-scale for global economic impact.

As the FinTech space has grown and evolved, so have we. And we want to make sure our brand reflects the broadening FinTech industry and our role within it. Bringing new payment technologies to market, which was our original focus when Let’s Talk Payments was conceived, is still an exciting part of FinTech, but it’s no longer the only area in which technology is rapidly changing the financial services industry. That’s why we are of retiring our Let’s Talk Payments brand and consolidating our offerings under one name: MEDICI.

MEDICI moves us all forward together, offering a more streamlined, seamless set of offerings for every member of the FinTech ecosystem: individuals, startups and enterprises.

**What will be different after the brands consolidate?**

Our commitment to serving every stakeholder in the FinTech ecosystem has not changed. You’ll still get the great products and services you’ve come to expect from us, but by consolidating our Let’s Talk Payments and MEDICI brands and products into a single, powerful entity, our whole will become greater than the sum of its parts. Our unique FinTech industry insights, data points, and connections will become an even more comprehensive portfolio of offerings that are better poised than ever to accelerate our clients’ company growth strategies through quick identification of target companies for commercial relationships, partnerships, investments or acquisitions.

Couple our enhanced impact with our proprietary [SCALE](/fintech-at-scale/) methodology and you can be assured that your investment in our products and services will provide tangible results.

**What can MEDICI do for you?**

**What does enabling FinTech-at-Scale mean?**

Innovation cannot be impactful if it is not at scale. A few people using Apple Pay or Google Wallet do not make change. But billions of people, adopting thousands of such new products, supported by thousands of startups collaborating with hundreds of large enterprises… that’s what results in real global economic impact. And we believe that FinTech has the potential to create this impact.

FinTech is an enabling industry because it affects the movement of money. Just as the railroad industry transformed how businesses across a wide swath of other industries transported their goods back in the 19th century, FinTech’s impact today also ripples out far and wide. Dairy farmers in India, grocery stores in Italy, and countless other industries around the world move money better, faster, and cheaper because of FinTech.

FinTech-at-Scale happens when we collaborate. MEDICI is committed to fostering this collaboration and, therefore, each and every one of our clients becomes a part of our mission.

---

**What is the SCALE methodology?**

We understand the importance of innovating and impacting at scale. Our proprietary SCALE methodology takes an expansive world view of FinTech and solves for individual enterprise objectives, one client at a time.

Every step of SCALE is designed to efficiently marry the centuries-old organizational knowledge held by large financial institutions with the technology-enabled experiences startups are creating for demanding customers. It solves for rapid learning from the financial services ecosystem, precise application of that learning to an organization’s needs, and reaching back out to the ecosystem to inspire a cycle of sustainable, collaborative innovation.

**Will Let’s Talk Payments go away?**

As a brand and unique URL, yes, Let’s Talk Payments will go away.

But the essence of the Let’s Talk Payments content hub will continue to exist in its entirety, under the newly consolidated MEDICI brand (and website). And, in fact, it will be stronger than ever.

For five years and counting, it’s been the center of gravity for the FinTech community, providing insightful research, content, and thought leadership that continues to shape FinTech today. By moving it under the MEDICI umbrella, we better represent its content, which has long supported the entire FinTech ecosystem, not just emerging payment technology.

**Will MEDICI still have a content platform?**

Yes. The valuable insights you’ve come to expect from the Let’s Talk Payments content platform will continue to exist, but they will be folded into the MEDICI brand and website.
